# PowerShell File Creator

Just a simple PowerShell script to create a new file of a specified size to test whatever you want.

## How to use

You just need to replace the PATH\testfile.txt with the path where you want to create the file. The SetLength(5gb) function is used to set the size of the file. In the current version, it's set to 5GB, but you can change it as per your requirements.
